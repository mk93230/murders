we downloaded the murders data by state
we calculated the rate of murders by state
plotted the bar graph indicating the rates and state abb
save the graph in the figs directory

also I created all these files in my local desktop.
I then created the murders repository in github
then I executed the following commands in the terminal
i.e "push an existing repository from the command line"
git remote add origin https://github.com/mk93230/murders.git
git push -u origin master
